            <p class="para">Tinker started off being a small coding challenge for me, my first bot in the complex world
                of Discord. The bot was originally named DevsApp and was developed to be a small personal helper bot for
                my programming Discord server "Devs". From there it began to grow, turn into a small project that I was
                really quite enjoying.</p>
            <p class="para">And then it happened, the day I decided to work on this properly and produce a bot that the
                people of Discord could actually use. First step - Re-brand! I renamed the bot to Tinker and began
                working on it independently from my programming server.</p>
            <p class="para">I wasn't sure where to start, I mean I had the basics of the bot working but what was it
                going to do, what was its purpose. But there was one thing I was absolutely certain of, I wanted to stay
                in-keeping with Discord's style, professional yet... slightly sassy.</p>
            <p class="para">So the bot progressed with all the standard commands: help and ping, moderation, fun stuff
                like jokes and memes and then what I called the "messages update". This was the moment I decided Tinker
                was going to be an all-rounder, a must-have for any server a better MEE6!</p>
            <p class="para">Yeah... I was pretty ambitious, but it gave me something to do when I was bored (as a
                student that was surprisingly often!).</p>
            <p class="para">And that almost brings you to present day, to the Tinker you know and love (or at least
                should know soon!) The coolest helping hand, See you around!</p>
