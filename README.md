## About

Tinker started off being a small coding challenge for me, my first bot in the complex world of Discord. The bot was originally named DevsApp and was developed to be a small personal helper bot for my programming Discord server "Devs". From there it began to grow, turn into a small project that I was really quite enjoying. 

And then it happened, the day I decided to work on this properly and produce a bot that the people of Discord could actually use. First step - Re-brand! I renamed the bot to Tinker and began working on it independently from my programming server.

I wasn't sure where to start, I mean I had the basics of the bot working but what was it going to do, what was its purpose. But there was one thing I was absolutely certain of, I wanted to stay in-keeping with Discord's style, professional yet... slightly sassy.

So the bot progressed with all the standard commands: help and ping, moderation, fun stuff like jokes and memes and then what I called the "messages update". This was the moment I decided Tinker was going to be an all-rounder, a must-have for any server a better MEE6!

Yeah... I was pretty ambitious, but it gave me something to do when I was bored (as a student that was surprisingly often!).

And that almost brings you to present day, to the Tinker you know and love (or at least should know soon!) The coolest helping hand, See you around!

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

However they require a lot of work to go through, check for malicious intent, bugs, compatibility issues and even style! And there are very few developers so we thank you in advance for your patience.
